# UI Element Highlighter Tool

The **UI Element Highlighter Tool** is a powerful Unity Editor extension designed to improve the workflow for developers and designers working with Unity's UI system. This tool offers an intuitive interface within the Unity Editor, allowing users to easily navigate, identify, and interact with `RectTransform` components in the Scene View.

## Features

-   **Interactive UI Element List**: Displays a hierarchical list of all UI elements within the Scene or Prefab Editor, providing a clear overview of the UI structure. This feature simplifies navigation through complex UI hierarchies.
-   **Scene View Highlighting**: Highlights the corresponding UI element in the Scene View when hovered over in the list. The highlight colors for both fill and outline are customizable.
-   **Customizable Highlight Colors**: Users can personalize the fill and outline colors of the highlight through a settings window, tailoring the appearance to fit their preferences or project themes.
-   **Layer and Tag Ignoring**: Offers the capability to specify layers and tags to ignore. This prevents certain UI elements from appearing in the list and being highlighted, streamlining the UI selection process.
-   **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate smoothly within Unity's existing UI and Editor workflow, enhancing productivity without disrupting the familiar development environment.
